Entry for the [tarsnap logo contest](http://mail.tarsnap.com/tarsnap-users/msg00678.html) announced on
September 28, 2013.

One of tarsnap's features is that it conserves resources by [de-duplicating data](https://www.tarsnap.com/efficiency.html). 
So the logo is an abstract depiction of blocks of data being copied across a barrier, 
with de-duplication. It also invokes the letter *T* for tarsnap.

The typeface is [Aller Display](http://www.daltonmaag.com/AllerFreeLicenceAgreement.pdf), 
available under the [Aller Free License Agreement](http://www.daltonmaag.com/AllerFreeLicenceAgreement.pdf).

I whipped this up in a few minutes. It could be cleaned up and tweaked if this general direction seems worthy, or
someone else can modify and improve it - it's licensed under Creative Commons.
