Entry for the [tarsnap logo contest](http://mail.tarsnap.com/tarsnap-users/msg00678.html) announced on
September 28, 2013.

One of tarsnap's features is that it conserves resources by [de-duplicating data](https://www.tarsnap.com/efficiency.html). 
So the logo is an abstract depiction of blocks of data being copied across a barrier, 
with de-duplication. It also invokes the letter *T* for tarsnap.

The typeface is [Aller Display](http://www.daltonmaag.com/AllerFreeLicenceAgreement.pdf), 
available under the [Aller Free License Agreement](http://www.daltonmaag.com/AllerFreeLicenceAgreement.pdf). Under the terms
of this license, the full version of the font would have to be paid for (CAD$67.00) if used in a logo or on 
a website. Free and free-as-in-freedom alternatives could be found, but I haven't seen one I like better yet.

The logo is intentionally very abstract, as I think that fulfills cperciva's design requirements that it look
strong and secure, without falling into clich&eacute;s like moats and locks. 

cperciva also wants to communicate strong unix heritage and geekiness. I tried to do that by making the font 
look a little bit like a programmer's font, with `tarsnap` all lowercase, but perhaps a monospace font would work better. I didn't
find one that I really liked. 

I whipped this up in a few minutes. It could be cleaned up and tweaked if this general direction seems worthy, or
someone else can modify and improve it - it's licensed under Creative Commons.
